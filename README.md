A place for me to test GitHub features that I have not used before, so that I know how to use them properly in my actual projects.

**<p align="center">This place is for testing only and therefore, I will be unlikely to respond to any Pull Requests or issues opened. 
<br>That doesn't mean you can't open them, I'll just be very unlikely to take any notice.</p>**
